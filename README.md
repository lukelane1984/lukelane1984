- 👋 Hi, I’m @lukelane1984. Call me Luke. Even though I'm quite introverted and perhaps a bit shy, I'm also kind, patient, and always happy to help others whenever I can.
    
- 👀 I’m interested in: Well, basically everything lol, but some of my main interests and hobbies are: human anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, neurology, neuro-psychology, neuro-linguistics, socio-linguistics, anthropology, paleontology, cosmology, particle physics, strength training, playing the guitar, gaming, watching documentaries, reading non-fiction, collecting and solving twisty-puzzles (variations on the Rubik's cube, but preferably more compex), collecting decks of cards, doing card magic, and learning languages (main focus is on Japanese right now). So, I basically collect hobbies and interests, and I'm very passionate about the things I do.
    
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: My main focus is on Python right now. But I have some past experience with Object Pascal, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and PHP. I'd like to learn some other languages in the future as well. Maybe C/C++/C# or Java, or Rust, I'm not sure yet. For now my plan is to master Python, then maybe spend a few years working as a Python developer. I'd still take the time learn other languages and different frameworks, keep expanding my skillset and knowledge. And then, who knows, maybe I'll travel around the world for a while. We'll see what the future brings.
     
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: For now, not sure. But once I become more competent, comfortable and confident as a developer, I'd be happy to contribute to, or collaborate on, any project I'm interested in or is in any way helpful or important.
   
- 📫 How to reach me: If, for whatever reason, you'd like to contact me directly, you can email me at:
  
  { lf_vanderlaan (at) protonmail (dot) com }
